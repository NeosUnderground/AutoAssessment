Instructions:

Using the included assets, please create a single responsive webpage that matches the supplied comp.
Page must display correctly on a mobile phone and desktop Chrome.

We use custom styling on all our websites and apps, so please don't use a css framework such as Bootstrap, etc.

Using javascript, create the following interactions:
- Header navigation item click should change the header background color for 2 seconds
- Footer navigation item click should change the order of the footer nav items
- Form submit should open a dialog box with the entered form data

Any decisions not outlined above are up to you.

Because emailing js files can be tricky, to return your finished site you can:
- Upload your files to github and send the link, or
- Change your .js extensions to .txt and email the files back in a .zip folder

p.s.
You don't need to copy the paragraph text exactly. Any filler text will do.

Thanks!
